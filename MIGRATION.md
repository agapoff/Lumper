# Open Questions
1. SDP & ZTP: Separate or combined JIRA projects?
2. Users:
   1. Need to addd everyone in order to test (I'm pretty certain)
   2. When adding users, do they get an e-mail?
3. What should the default issue type be?
4. Statuses -> Resolutions:
   1. Should we remove the 3 ending statuses that in JIRA-terms are actually resolutions?
5. Should we use Done instead of Verified? Or remove Done?
6. Fix For vs Fix versions
7. Other projects:
   1. Active: Documentation, Design
   2. Non-Active: not planning on migrating, but lots of history

# TODO, but not a problem now/yet:
* ZTNA Permission Scheme -> separate permissions into groups
* Add users
* Versions
* Components
* Notifications

# With a new project, for me to manually update:
* Screen Layout

# Post-migration, for me to manually update:
* Workflows: restrictions on transistions?
