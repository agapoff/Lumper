We need to extend it and unify it.\n\n[Design](https://internal-system/design/BVwjGDjelz3CwV9ITXZE8I/Handoff---App-Discovery-Enhancements-for-v1.0?node-id=1-5&p=f&t=eWygsPQR630GTVTc-0)\n\n## Background\n\nCustomers have described their approach to prioritize which applications they want to secure next. One of the approaches is to focus on applications that use a specific port. For example, an admin wants to narrow entitlements for SSH access, or database management ports, and so on. To simply their experience, the administrator needs the ability to filter the list of discovered apps by port(s).\n\n## Definition of done\n\nSearch ability according to design suggestion\n\n## Limitation\n\nSaving searches will be split out to a separate thing.",
    "releaseNote": "Includes:\n- Pinned search\n- New keywords for advanced search\n- Removed system-wide filtered list\n",
