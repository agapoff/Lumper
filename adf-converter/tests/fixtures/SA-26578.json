It also needs to be made clear that when traffic is being relayed that relay induces cost and latency. \n\n\n* As networks are setup differently, the limit for what is acceptable amount of relay traffic needs to be configurable.\n\n\n* It should be easy for the administrator to see that no traffic is negotiated by the Connection Broker as that would indicate that there is a misconfiguration. \n\n\n* It should be easy for the administrator to see when the Connection Broker is over utilized. \n\n\n* It should be easy for the administrator to see how an active session is connected directly to the GW or if it is being relayed. "
