Nginx settings: Nginx is a TLS endpoint hiding controller and sessiond behind. It must be verified in same manner like our VPN daemon. there is a know security flaw already [<a href="/issue/SA-1069" class="issue-resolved" target="_self" data-issue-id="36-8032" title="Enable certificate verification in nginx">GW-356</a>]<br/><br/>Examples: There was a case long time ago that the client could start a TLS connection with simple DH instead of ECDHE. The correct behavior is to drop everything except ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384. Another case were that the certificates produced had poor key size and SHA1 as signature.</div>
